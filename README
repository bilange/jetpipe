This file ports the jetpipe.py script from the LTSP project to the C 
programming language.

This port has been created in order to get rid of the Python dependency (>20Mb)
in my static, non-LTSP ultra lightweight thin client solution. It is however a 
bit more verbose than the original python script for diagnostic purposes.

Although this port is complete feature-wise compared to jetpipe.py, I do not
affirm that it has no known or otherwise bugs. Go easy, this is my 
baby footsteps in C :-)

Usage: 
./jetpipe <device> <port>

Where <device> is usually a lp port located in /dev/lp*
      <port> is a TCP port, usually 9100.

To compile: gcc -o jetpipe jetpipe.c
